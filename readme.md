# ChatApp - Real-Time Messaging Platform

![ChatApp Banner](./assets/banner.png)

## 🚀 Overview

ChatApp is a modern, real-time messaging platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Socket.io. It allows users to communicate instantly in a secure and scalable environment, featuring user authentication, private and group chats, and online presence indicators.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Socket.io-client, Axios, React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, JWT Authentication
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Deployment**: [Your Deployment Platform] <!-- Add your deployment platform here -->

## 📸 Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration with JWT.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instant message delivery using Socket.io.
- **Private & Group Chats**: Communicate one-on-one or in groups.
- **Online Presence**: See who is online in real-time.
- **Message History**: Access previous conversations.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🔧 Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhijit-01/chat-App.git
cd chat-App
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file and add the following environment variables:

env
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

🔐 Authentication Flow
User Registration: Users can sign up by providing a username, email, and password. The backend validates the input and stores the user information in the database.

User Login: Upon successful login, a JWT is generated and sent to the client, which is then used for subsequent authenticated requests.

Token Verification: For protected routes, the server verifies the JWT to authenticate the user.

⚡ Real-Time Communication
Socket.io is used to establish a WebSocket connection between the client and server.

Users can join specific rooms (e.g., based on their username or group) to send and receive messages in real-time.

The server emits events like message, user-connected, and user-disconnected to manage the chat state.

🌐 Deployment
To deploy this application:

Backend: Deploy the backend on platforms like Heroku, Render, or Railway. Ensure that the MongoDB URI and JWT secret are set as environment variables.

Frontend: Deploy the frontend on platforms like Vercel or Netlify. Update the API base URL in the frontend to point to the deployed backend.

### 📌 Notes:

- **Screenshots**: Replace the placeholder image URLs (`https://example.com/...`) with actual URLs of your application's screenshots. You can upload images to your repository or use an image hosting service.
  
- **Deployment**: Update the deployment instructions based on your actual deployment platforms and configurations.

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that sensitive information like your MongoDB URI and JWT secret are not hardcoded in your codebase. Use environment variables to manage them securely.
